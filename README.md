# Multithreading intro

Create and start in `main()` method 2 threads: the first extending `Thread`, and the second implementing `Runnable`.
One of the threads should print out numbers from 0 to 20.
The other one should contain an infinite loop where the message "I am the daemon thread!" is printed to the console.
Please make this thread a daemon :)
